Things we have to work on:

-pawn
-
-
-promotion
-
-is your king in check?
-is the other king in check?
-if it's check, is it check-mate?





here is what happens with move:

-you propose a move
-if the proposed move is valid, then you make the move
-after the move is made, check if making the move puts YOUR king in check
-if it does, the move is not valid
-if it doesn't you're good


what is a checkmate:
	-basically, the king tries moving to every possible adjacent square, and if that square puts him in check, that's a checkmate
